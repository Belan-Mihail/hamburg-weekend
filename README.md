### Design Choices

The site is designed to maximize the interest of users and provide them with brief but meaningful information about the objects of interest to them. The main focus should be on providing the user with more visual information about sights and places for recreation, as well as on the convenience of the user in moving around the site.

### Colors

For the text content on the site, a white color was chosen, which contrasts well with the dark background of the site. Green and orange were chosen for the accent as well as for the hover effects. The text content in the photo was overlaid with an orange accent. I used Adobe Color to select the color.
